        <h1 class="topic">Top 5 Gorgeous Beaches in Sri Lanka</h1>

        <p class="topicDesc">The beautiful island country of Sri Lanka is no short of natural beauty. For those of you who 
            don’t know, Sri Lanka is a cluster of islands. What’s the first thing which comes to your mind when we say island? 
            Beaches, of course. That is exactly what Sri Lanka is famous for.Crafted from a 1340km (833-mile) coastline, 
            its countless topographically varied beaches, coves and bays attract sun-seekers, fun lovers and surfers throughout 
            the year. Wildlife plays its part too – beaches are vital nesting grounds for endangered marine turtles, 
            while blue whales are sighted at sea. Sri Lanka beaches are a slice of heaven, well known for their idyllic 
            scenery, colorful wildlife, and excellent surfing. From east to west, every beach has its own unique character, 
            from white sand bars and tidal islands to palm tree beach swings and bohemian beach bars. Plus, there’s something 
            for every kind of traveler, whether you’re an advanced surfer looking to find the best waves or a hammock lover 
            looking to relax, sip fresh coconuts, and paddle in the shallows. Whatever you’re after, spending time on the 
            beaches is an absolute must Do in Sri Lanka!

                        this is the beauty of Unawatuna. This beach is easily the most popular beach on the southern Sri 
                        Lankan coast. .Unawatuna, 6km (3.7 miles) from history-laden Galle Fort, is still one of the most 
                        sought-after swimming beaches in Sri Lanka, despite encroaching development. Thanks to an offshore 
                        reef, its azure water is relatively calm for most of the year. Sun beds line the beach, Jet Skis 
                        buzz around the bay and although it gets busy during peak season, it never feels crowded. 
                        Unawatuna’s dining scene is sophisticated, and there are regular weekend beach parties.

                        Arugam Bay is amongst the top beaches in Sri Lanka known especially for surfing. The blue waters of 
                        the Arugam bay provide ample opportunities for fishing and underwater photography. Arugam Bay is 
                        synonymous with one of the best surfing points across the world. You can rent all the basic 
                        equipment from the locals shop and indulge in this activity. In fact, there are even international 
                        surf competitions now held here. 
                        Because every day brings excellent waves, many surfers make Arugam Bay their home during the peak 
                        surfing period (April to September). Despite its notoriety, the area still has that remote beachy 
                        feel, with wooden cabins lining the beach and palm tree forests. However, it also has fantastic 
                        restaurants, cafes, and bars close to the center, where you can find lots of international dishes 
                        and bohemian outdoor terraces.

                        Nilaveli, 13km (8 miles) north of Trincomalee, is a 4km-long (2.5-mile) east-coast beach 
                        characterized by wide ivory sands, palmyra palms and roaming cattle. Between May and September, 
                        when the shallow ocean laps gently onto the beach, Nilaveli becomes Sri Lanka’s deep-sea diving 
                        and whale-watching hub. Just offshore lies Pigeon Island’s protected marine park – home to turtles 
                        and blacktip reef sharks, it’s one of the best sites for snorkeling and diving in the country.
                        This beach is a long, endless stretch of white sand backed by shallow, crystal blue water that looks 
                        almost too good to be real. Here, time stands still as cows wander slowly down the beach, and 
                        there’s almost not a person in sight.

                        Weligama’s smiling 2km (1.2-mile) bay has emerged as one of the best surfing beaches in Sri Lanka 
                        for beginners, thanks to a forgiving sandy-bottomed break. Rent boards and book lessons from the 
                        surf outfits to the west of the bay – most are run by young surfers with first-hand knowledge of 
                        the local breaks. Weligama’s fine sand attracts families too, and there are plenty of places to eat, 
                        drink and sleep in every price range. It's the most ideal beach for surfing as there is no danger of 
                        sharks. A perfect destination to enjoy diving and snorkeling as it is guarded by shallow coral reef.

                        Sri Lanka’s west coast is dominated by large package-holiday hotels basking over fine stretches of 
                        sand. The best is Bentota, where the long honey-hued beach ends in a spit of sand separating the 
                        Indian Ocean from a big lagoon. A combination of water sports, decent swimming and lifeguards 
                        attract families, though there are no independent restaurants on the beach itself. If you are looking 
                        for a Sri Lankan beach holiday and wish to stay at resorts that specialize in medicine centers and 
                        relaxing spa, Bentota is the place for you. It is one of the most beautiful beaches in Sri Lanka 
                        and is a perfect getaway for tourists who are looking to spend a few days away from the hustle and 
                        bustle of the city.
