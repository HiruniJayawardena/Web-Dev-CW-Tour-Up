      <h1 class="topics">Kandy</h1>
      <p class="blog">
        A lot of travelers visit Sri Lanka for its white-sand beaches and world-class surfing, but the island's
        mountainous, pearl-shrouded center also contains a spiritually appealing zone with tea farms, misty hills, and
        those iconic blue train carriages.
        <br><br>
        Kandy, also known as the City of Kings, is Sri Lanka's second city and the undisputed historical and cultural
        center of the island. It serves as the entrance to all of this hill country action (as well as the best train
        trip in the world!).
        <br><br>
        The strong ancient Kingdom of Kandy, shielded by its location and less-accessible terrain, was able to fend off
        both Portuguese and Dutch colonizers during the 1500s and 1600s, becoming the last stronghold of independent
        Ceylon. Up until 1815, when it ultimately submitted to British rule, the city was able to maintain the
        distinctive customs, culture, and arts that had been severely suppressed elsewhere in the nation.
        <br><br>
        The numerous important cultural and historic locations in the city still preserve that culture today, serving as
        the inspiration for all the top attractions in Kandy. The most well-known of these is the Temple of the Tooth
        relic, which is also the most significant sacred site in Buddhism and is thought to contain a piece of Buddha's
        tooth.
        <br><br>
        Kandy is a city of delightful chaos with bustling streets, historic temples, colonial architecture, aristocratic
        gardens, and the magnificent Kandy Lake as the background to a perfect few days in Sri Lanka's verdant hills,
        but it is also much more than just its main draw.
        <br><br>
        There are so many great things to see and do in Kandy.Such as,
      <div class="places">
        <ul>
          <li>Temple of the Scared Tooth Relic</li>
          <li>Royal Botanic Gardens Peradeniya</li>
          <li>Kandy Cultural Dance Show</li>
          <li>Gadaladeniya Viharaya</li>
          <li>Embekke Dewalaya </li>
          <li>Lankathilaka Viharaya</li>
          <li>Bahirawakanda Viharaya </li>
          <li>Walk the Picturesque Kandy Lake</li>
          <li>Explore the Market Street of Kandy Old Town</li>
        </ul>

      </div>

      <p class="blog">

      <h1 class="topics">Galle</h1>
      <p class="blog">
        The stunning UNESCO World Heritage Site of Galle is located on Sri Lanka's southern shore. There are many
        fascinating places to explore in this old town, including its charming and winding lanes, commanding Dutch
        colonial structures, historic mosques, churches, and the well-known lighthouse. The substantial ramparts that
        the Dutch merchants who ruled the city in the 17th century constructed can be traveled by walking.
        <br><br>
        Galle was initially taken over by the Portuguese in the late 16th century, but the Dutch seized it very rapidly
        in the following century. After that, for more than 200 years, it developed into a very significant spice
        trading center.
        <br><br>
        Within the many historical structures that make up the fort's surroundings, the 300-year-old Dutch atmosphere is
        still very much alive. The community has expanded significantly over the years and now encompasses a large area.
        The beating heart of Galle's past, however, is and will always be the Dutch Fort. Since its construction in the
        early 16th century, the fortified city has maintained its historical character. The city of Galle is a
        cosmopolitan mix of cultures, religions, and fascinating Dutch imperial structures.
        <br><br>
        Additionally, there are lots of adorable boutique stores, cozy cafés, and restaurants where you can refuel.
        <br><br>
        Here are some things that yoy can do and see in Galle,
        <br><br>
      <div class="places">
        <ul>
          <li>Galle Lighthouse</li>
          <li>Go Shopping At The Boutique Shops</li>
          <li>Walk on the Ramparts and of Galle Fort</li>

    <div class="SecDambulla">
      <h1 class="topics">Dambulla</h1>
      <p class="blog">
        Dambulla is situated in Sri Lanka's Central Province in the Matale District, 148 kilometers (92 miles) to the
        northeast of Colombo and 72 kilometers (45 miles) to the north of Kandy. It is the largest center for vegetable
        distribution in the Sri Lanka because of its position at a significant intersection.
        <br><br>
        The biggest and best preserved cave temple complex in Sri Lanka and the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium,
        known for being constructed in just 167 days, are two of the area's main draws. Additionally, the region is home
        to the Iron Wood Forest, also known as Na Uyana Aranya, and South Asia's biggest range of rose quartz mountains.
        <br><br>
        The most recent archaeological site of significant historical importance discovered in Dambulla is the
        Ibbankatuwa prehistoric burial site, which is close to the cave temple complexes. It is only 3 km (1.9 mi) away
        from the cave temples and provides proof of the existence of indigenous civilisations long before Indian
        influence arrived on the Island nation.
        <br><br>
        As above mentioned here are the places that you can visit around Dambulla,

      <h1 class="topics">Sigiriya</h1>
      <p class="blog">
        One of the most well-known sights to see in Sri Lanka is Lion Rock in Sigiriya, a huge (200 m) square-shaped
        rock that was once King Kassapa's fortress and has since become home to murals, gardens, and, on top of the
        rock, a swimming pool and palace. Lion Rock is one of the eight UNESCO World Heritage sites and is a must-see in
        Sri Lanka!
        <br><br>
        Get ready for a little challenge and climb the more than 1200 stairs to the highest point of Lion Rock. Do not
        be afraid; Good paths and steps are used to mark out the climb. The most impressive view of the mountain is
        provided by beginning at the terrace gardens.
        <br><br>
        You can take a break at the the mirror wall, and the Sigiriya Frescoes (old wall paintings).Enjoy the
        breathtaking 360-degree view of the entire area once you reach the highest point of the rock. Every angle offers
        a different perspective.
        <br><br>
        To avoid the heat and crowds of people, climbing Lion Rock is advised starting at 7 AM. Approximately 45 minutes
        will be needed to reach the reaching the top. You will need two to three hours to thoroughly investigate the
        entire region beneath and above the rock.

        One of the best spots to go on a safari in Sri Lanka is Udawalawe National Park! There, you will likely find a
        lot of creatures, including elephants. One of the best activities to do in Sri Lanka is to visit Udawalawe!
        <br><br>
        With 30.8 hectares, Udawalawe Park is one of Sri Lanka's biggest parks.
        In 1972, the Sri Lankan government established the Udawalawe National Park to safeguard the wildlife. There are
        thought to be about 500 elephants living on the 30,000 hectares. There are additional animals that you can see.
        Indeed, there are almost 250 different bird types and about 40 different mammal species.
        <br><br>
        Early in the morning or late in the day are the two ideal times of day to go on a wildlife drive in the
        park.Tours in the afternoon are frequently less crowded, and you can see the stunning dusk inside the park.
        <br><br>
        And the safari usually lasts for 2 to 3 hours.We can guarantee that you can really enjoy it and see a lot of
        wildlife.
