      <h1>Sri Lankan Heritages</h1>
      <p>
        The three elements used to describe historic heritage are Fabric, Stories 
        and Culture. One or all of these things make up the historic heritage of a place.
        Of all the ancient sites the most famed and most exquisite is the Kingdom 
        of Anuradhapura. Sri Lanka‚Äôs third and the longest serving capital and one 
        of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world is also one of the 
        most sacred cities of World Buddhists. It was the capital of Sri Lanka from 
        the Fourth Century BC up to the turn of the eleventh Century and was one of 
        the most stable and durable centers of political power and urban life in 
        South Asia. However the city itself is much older than the Kingdom of 
        Anuradhapura and according to archeological evidence could have originated 
        as far as tenth century BC. Anuradhapura was abandoned due to the due to 
        repeated South Indian Invasions and was eventually forgotten with time until 
        it was rediscovered in the early 19 th century.
        <br><br>
        As of 2022, Sri Lanka has eight sites on the list. The first three sites, 
        the Ancient City of Polonnaruwa, the Ancient City of Sigiriya, and the 
        Sacred City of Anuradhapura, were listed in 1982. The most recent site, 
        the Central Highlands of Sri Lanka, was listed in 2010. The Central Highlands
        and the Sinharaja Forest Reserve are natural sites, the other six are cultural. 
        In addition, Sri Lanka has three sites on its tentative list. The country 
        served as a member of the World Heritage Committee in the years 1983‚Äì1989.

            The Sri Dalada Maligawa or The Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic is a temple in 
            the city of Kandy in Sri Lanka. It was built within the royal palace complex which 
            houses the tooth relic of the Buddha, a tooth, which is venerated by Buddhists. The 
            relic has played an important role in the local politics since ancient times, it's 
            believed that whoever holds the relic holds the governance of the country, which 
            caused the ancient kings to protect it with great effort. Kandy was the capital of 
            the Sinhalese Kings from 1592 to 1815, fortified by the terrain of the mountains and 
            the difficult approach. The city is a world heritage site declared by UNESCO, in 
            part due to the temple.
            <br /><br />
            Monks of the two chapters of Malwatte and Asgiriya conduct daily ritual worship in 
            the inner chamber of the temple, in annual rotation. They conduct these services three 
            times a day: at dawn, at noon and in the evening. On Wednesdays there is a symbolic 
            bathing of the Sacred Relic with an herbal preparation made from scented water and 
            flagrant flowers, called Nanumura Mangallaya. This holy water is believed to contain 
            healing powers and is distributed among those present. The Temple has sustained 
            damage from multiple bombings by terrorists in the past, but has been fully restored each time.

            Sigiriya, considered by some as the eighth wonder of the world, consists of an 
            ancient castle used by King Kasyapa of the 5th century AD. The Sigiriya site 
            has the remains of an upper Sky Palace sited on the flat top of the rock, a 
            mid-level terrace that includes the Lion Gate and the Mirror Wall and the 
            Sigiriya Frescoes, the lower palace that clings to the slopes below the rock, 
            and the moats, walls and gardens that extend for some hundreds of metres out 
            from the base of the rock. 
            <br /><br />
            The site is both a palace and fortress. Sufficient remains to provide the 
            visitor with a stunning insight into the ingenuity and creativity of its builders.
            The upper palace on the top of the rock includes cisterns cut into the rock that 
            still retain water. The moats and walls that surround the lower palace are still 
            exquisitely beautiful.

            capital Colombo in the North Central Province of Sri Lanka, on the banks 
            of the historic Malvathu Oya. Founded in the 4th century BC it was the capital 
            of the Anuradhapura Kingdom till the beginning of the 11th century AC. During

            The second most ancient of Sri Lanka's kingdoms, Polonnaruwa was first declared 
            the capital city by King Vijayabahu I, who defeated the Chola invaders in 1070 CE 
            to reunite the country once more under a local leader. While Vijayabahu's victory 
            and shifting of Kingdoms to the more strategic Polonnaruwa is considered significant, 
            the real Polonnaruwa Hero of the history books is actually his grandson, 
            Parakramabahu I. The city Polonnaruwa was also called as Jananathamangalam during 
            the short Chola reign. 
            <br /><br />
            However, with the exception of his immediate successor, Nissankamalla I, 
            all other monarchs of Polonnaruwa were slightly weak-willed and rather prone 
            to picking fights within their own court. They also went on to form more intimiate 
            matrimonial alliances with stronger South Indian Kingdoms, until these 
            matrimonial links superseded the local royal lineage and gave rise to the Kalinga 
            invasion by King Magha in 1214 and the eventual passing of power into the hands 
            of a Pandyan King following the Arya Chakrawarthi invasion of Sri Lanka in 1284. 
            The capital was then shifted to Dambadeniya.
