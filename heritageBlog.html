    <h1> Heritage Places in Sri Lanka</h1>
    <p>
      With a 3000 year history, Sri Lanka is home to some of the world's most ancient cities, such as Anuradhapura,
      Polonnaruwa, and Digamadulla. These cities' once magnificent townships, palaces, temples, monasteries, hospitals,
      and theaters, all of which were intricately carved and modeled out of stone, have since been abandoned and
      forgotten amidst the country's towering jungles.
      <br>
      <br>
      The Kingdom of Anuradhapura is the most renowned and beautiful of all the ancient cities in Lanka.
      One of the oldest continuously inhabited towns in the world and Sri Lanka's third and longest-serving capital is
      also one of the most revered by Buddhists worldwide.It served as Sri Lanka's capital from the Fourth Century BC
      until the turn of the eleventh Century and was one of South Asia's most enduring and stable hubs of political
      authority and urban activity.
      During the Anuradhapura era, Digamadulla, the Eastern kingdom of Sri Lanka, served as the nation's agricultural
      and spiritual center.
      The Kingdom of Kandy, the final kingdom in Sri Lanka, is proof of the country's people's capacity to emerge from
      the ashes.
