      <h1>Wild Safaries in Sri Lanka</h1>
      <p>
        Despite its small size Sri Lanka boasts of one of the highest rates of
        biological endemism in the world whether in plants or animals and is
        included among the top five biodiversity hotspots in the world. Of the
        ninety-one species of mammals found in Sri Lanka Asian elephants, sloth
        bear, leopards, sambar and wild buffaloes engages the majority of the
        attention of wildlife enthusiast. Yet the rarest mammals of Sri Lanka
        are the red slender Loris, Toque Macaque, and Purple-faced Langur, who
        according to IUCN clarifications are endangered due to habitat loss.
        Meanwhile the ocean around Sri Lanka is home to large families of
        cetaceans including the mighty blue whales, sperm whales and lively
        dolphins. Altogether 26 species of cetaceans rule the waters surrounding
        the country, making it one of the best locations for whale and dolphin
        watching. <br /><br />
        Despite the mighty elephants and rare amphibians found in the country
        birds are the glory of the Sri Lanka’s wildlife. Boasting nearly 433
        bird species of which 233 are resident Sri Lanka holds 20 endemic
        species while another 80 species have developed distinct Sri Lankan
        races, compared to their cousins in Indian mainland. Although less
        celebrated, Sri Lanka has one of the richest diversity of amphibians in
        the world, containing over 106 species of amphibians of over 90 of which
        are endemic. The country has long claimed to have the highest amphibian
        species density in the world with a high concentration in the Sinharaja
        rainforest.

            Yala National Park is the most visited and second largest national
            park in Sri Lanka, bordering the Indian Ocean. The park consists of
            five blocks, with three of which are now open to the public. There
            are also two adjoining parks, Kumana National Park or 'Yala East'
            and Lunugamvehera National Park. The blocks have individual names,
            such as Ruhuna National Park (Block 1). It is situated in the
            southeastern region of the country, in the Southern Province and Uva
            Province. The park covers 979 square kilometres (378 sq mi) and is
            located about 300 kilometres (190 mi) from Colombo. Yala was
            designated as a wildlife sanctuary in 1900, along with Wilpattu,
            designated in 1938 as one of the first two designated national parks
            in Sri Lanka. The park is best known for its variety of wildlife. It
            is important conservation of Sri Lankan elephants, Sri Lankan
            leopards and aquatic birds. There are six national parks and three
            wildlife sanctuaries in the vicinity of Yala. Among the largest is
            Lunugamvehera National Park.
            <br /><br />
            The park is situated in the dry semi-arid climatic region and rain
            is received mainly during the northeast monsoon. Yala hosts a
            variety of ecosystems ranging from moist monsoon forests to
            freshwater and marine wetlands. It is one of the 70 Important Bird
            Areas (IBAs) in Sri Lanka. Yala harbors 215 bird species including
            six endemic species of Sri Lanka. The number of mammals that has
            been recorded from the park is 44, and it has one of the highest
            leopard densities in the world. The area around Yala has hosted
            several ancient civilizations. Two important Buddhist pilgrim sites,
            Sithulpahuwa and Magul Vihara, are situated within the park. The
            2004 Indian Ocean tsunami caused severe damage on the Yala National
            Park and 250 people died in its vicinity. The number of visitors has
            been on the rise since 2009, after the security situation in the
            park improved.

            Wilpattu National Park is a national park in Sri Lanka. The unique
            feature of this park is the existence of "Willus" (natural lakes) –
            natural, sand-rimmed water basins or depressions that fill with
            rainwater. Located on the northwest coast lowland dry zone of Sri
            Lanka, the park is 30 km (19 mi) west of Anuradhapura and 26 km (16
            mi) north of Puttalam (approximately 180 km (110 mi) north of
            Colombo). The park is 1,317 km2 (508 sq mi) (131,693 hectares) in
            area and ranges from 0–152 m (0–499 ft) above sea level. Nearly one
            hundred and six lakes (Willu) and tanks are found spread throughout
            Wilpattu. Wilpattu is the largest and one of the oldest national
            parks in Sri Lanka. Wilpattu is world-renowned for its leopard
            (Panthera pardus kotiya) population. <br /><br />
            A remote camera survey conducted in Wilpattu from July to October
            2015 by the Wilderness and Wildlife Conservation Trust captured
            photographs of forty-nine individual leopards in the surveyed area,
            the core area density of which was between that of Yala National
            Park's Block I and Horton Plains National Park.[2] From December
            1988 to 16 March 2003, the park was closed due to security concerns
            surrounding the Sri Lankan Civil War, before being reopened to
            visitors sixteen years later. Visitor access is currently limited to
            approximately 25% of the park, the remainder of which is dense
            forest or scrub. Popular visiting periods span between the months of
            February and October, although there are a number of private
            ecotourism groups that conduct safaris year-round

            Udawalawe National Park is a national park on the boundary of
            Sabaragamuwa and Uva Provinces in Sri Lanka. The park was created to
            provide a sanctuary for wild animals displaced by the construction
            of the Udawalawe Reservoir on the Walawe River, as well as to
            protect the catchment of the reservoir. The reserve covers 30,821
            hectares (119.00 sq mi) of land area and was established on 30 June
            1972.[1] Before the designation of the national park, the area was
            used for shifting cultivation (chena farming). The farmers were
            gradually removed once the national park was declared. The park is
            165 kilometres (103 mi) from Colombo. Udawalawe is an important
            habitat for water birds and Sri Lankan elephants. <br /><br />
            It is a popular tourist destination and the third-most visited park
            in the country. In the six months ending in August 2009, the park
            earned revenue of Rs. 18.2 million.[5] From 1994 to 2001 some
            423,000 people visited the park, 20% of them foreigners.[2] For the
            1998–2001 period average annual revenue was US$280,000. Postage
            stamps bearing the images of four wild animals of Udawalawe were
            issued on 31 October 2007 in the series "National Parks of Sri
            Lanka",[6] featuring water buffalo, Sri Lankan elephant, ruddy
            mongoose and tufted grey langur.
